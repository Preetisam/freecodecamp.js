/*However, you can use the ? character to change it to lazy matching. "titanic" matched against the adjusted regex of /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].

Note: Parsing HTML with regular expressions should be avoided, but pattern matching an HTML string with regular expressions is completely fine.
Fix the regex /<.*>/ to return the HTML tag <h1> and not the text "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>". Remember the wildcard . in a regular expression matches any character.*/
