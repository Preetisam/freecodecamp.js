let repeatStr = "row row row your boat";
/*You could use /row row row/, but what if you don't know the specific word repeated? Capture groups can be used to find repeated substrings.

Capture groups are constructed by enclosing the regex pattern to be captured in parentheses.
In this case, the goal is to capture a word consisting of alphanumeric characters so the capture group will be \w+ enclosed by parentheses: /(\w+)/.

The substring matched by the group is saved to a temporary "variable", 
which can be accessed within the same regex using a backslash and the number of the capture group (e.g. \1). 
Capture groups are automatically numbered by the position of their opening parentheses (left to right), starting at 1.

The example below matches a word that occurs thrice separated by spaces:*/


let repeatRegex = /(\w+) \1 \1/;
repeatRegex.test(repeatStr); // Returns true
repeatStr.match(repeatRegex); // Returns ["row row row", "row"]


let testString = "test test test";
let reRegex = /(test)\s\1/;
let result = reRegex.test(testString);



let re = /(test)\s\1/;
let literalRe = /test\stest/;


let testString = "test test test";
let reRegex = /(test)(\s)\1\2\1/;
let result = reRegex.test(testString);


let testString = "test test test test test test";
let reRegex = /(test)(\s)\1\2\1/g;
let result = reRegex.test(testString);


let repeatNum = "42 42 42";
let reRegex = /^(\d+)\s\1\s\1$/;
let result = reRegex.test(repeatNum);
